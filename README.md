#### PreDiabetes-Classification

## About this Project

Diabetes is a medical condition that affects an individual's ability to produce and use the hormone insulin. It is estimated that diabetic patients will exceed 642 million by 2040, therefore it is of interest to develop a diagnostic system that can catch these symptoms at an early stage (Alqushaibi et al., 2023). Prediabetes is a diagnostic term given to patients who are above normal thresholds but are not quite diabetic. Therefore, a diagnostic system able to track prediabetes would be beneficial in reducing and controlling the growing number of incidences. The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) conducts an annual survey by the Centre of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in which a series of lifestyle questions are gathered from a sample size of around 200,000 respondents (CDC, 2017). The respondents fall within three distinct classes; healthy, prediabetes and diabetes. This paper focuses on creating a progressive learning classification model that is more robust at detecting prediabetes within the given dataset. The results showed that the progressive learning model was able to correctly classify more positive cases of prediabetes than a standard baseline model.
